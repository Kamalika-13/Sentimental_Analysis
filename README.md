# Sentimental_Analysis
This project uses IMDB movie reviews to classify sentiment as positive or negative. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM), evaluation, and visualization. Perfect for beginners to learn NLP and machine learning with real data

🎯 Project Goal

Predict if a movie review is positive or negative using machine learning.

🧹 Text Cleaning

Clean and prepare the reviews by removing noise, punctuation, and stop words.

🤖 Models Used

Naive Bayes 🛠️

Logistic Regression 📈

LSTM (Deep Learning) 🌐

📊 Results

Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each model.

Visualizations like ROC curves and training graphs.

🔍 Error Analysis
Check why some reviews are misclassified (e.g., sarcasm, short reviews).

🌪️ Word Clouds
Visualize the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.

⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning
Improve model accuracy by tuning parameters (e.g., alpha, epochs).
